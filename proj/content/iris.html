      <p><b>Introduction</b> <br>

      I have always wanted to learn more about machine learning and machine intelligence, so I found a brief introductory project
      to familiarize myself with the discipline over the summer. I followed project instructions from
      <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Mastery</a>
      and completed the project on a weekend when I had some downtime from my internship.</p>

      <p><b>Process</b> <br>

      Since this project was meant to show me the basics of machine learning, the process was very simple and straightforward. I began
      this project by setting up a virtual environment complete with Python 3.7.6, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and sklearn.
      Then, I read thorugh the instructions and began to download
      <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv" target="_blank">the data</a>, which was all about
      irises. As the writer, Jason, described, the project was very easy to follow and did a great job of highlighting important concepts
      and tools for machine learning.</p>
