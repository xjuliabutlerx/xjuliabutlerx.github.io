      <p><b>Introduction</b> <br>
        My immediate family is stretched across 3 different "generations." My parents are both proud Baby Boomers
        while my older brother is a Millennial and I am a Gen Z. Years and dates aren't necessary for you to understand that there
        are some age gaps between the four of us. Although golf, dogs, and home-cooked meals make those age gaps seem
        much smaller, the four of us all seem to have somewhat distinct music tastes.</p>

      <p>In this data analysis project, I explore generation-defining music and attempt to use Spotify audio features to figure out what
        musical attributes are most appealing to each generation. However, as a violinist and music fan myself, I understand that
        numbers simply cannot quantify every characteristic in existence — especially when it comes to something as subjective as music.</p>

      <p><b>Research and Sampling Methods</b> <br>
        Before beginning data collection, I firstly defined the generations being analyzed. For this project, I am going to explore
        Baby Boomers (born between 1946-1964), Generation X (1965-1980), Millennials/Generation Y (1981-1996), and Generation Z
        (1997-2012). According to Google, these are the birth years generally considered for each generation.</p>

      <p>Next, I began to puruse popular music for each generation. (Note that "popular music" here does not necessarily mean pop music;
        I am referring to music that each generation liked to listened to and/or music that was popularized by a generation). Some of the
        articles that I found listed 10 songs that were popular at the time for each generation. While I could have used songs as the
        basis for this project, my sample sizes for each generation would have been miniscule. Also, it was hard to find top song lists
        that stretched an entire generation. Additionally, 10 songs are not necessarily representative of a whole generation's worth of
        popular music. Another route for collecting data could be selecting specific artists and using all of their music. Again, this
        would be a viable solution. However, it would run the risk of including music enjoyed by a different generation (leading to overlap)
        or including an artist that may have had a one hit wonder.</p>

      <p>After careful consideration, I eventually settled on finding the top 10 popular albums from each generation. It seemed to be
        the best of both worlds, considering that it captured a group of popular songs from an artists, but still allowed for artists
        with only a few popular songs. Additionally, songs for albums could include several singles that were released over a period
        of time. It is also reasonable to assume that albums include at least 5 to 8 songs, generating a sample of 50 to 80 songs per
        generation.</p>

      <p>Altogether, I explored 601 songs with 142 from the Baby Boomer generation, 200 from Generation X, 110 from Millennials,
        and 149 from Generation Z.</p>

      <p>Below is a table of the albums that I analyzed and sources for each of these lists are linked in their respective column

      <p><b>Data Collection and Analysis</b> <br>
        After gathering this list of albums, I began to research and learn the Python API Spotipy. This is a tool that allows me to
        connect some Python source code to
        <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify's Web API</a>. This tool would not
        only serve as a means of collecting all of the song titles, but also as my source of analysis. Spotify's Web API has audio
        track features that quantify characteristics of each song, such as the amount of spoken words and use of instruments rather
        than electronic synthesizers. On the
        <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-audio-features"
        target="_blank">Spotify API documentation</a>, there are 13 quantified characteristics defined:
        <span class="Attributes">Acousticness</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Danceability</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Duration</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Energy</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Instrumentalness</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Key</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Liveness</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Loudness</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Mode</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Speechiness</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Tempo</span>,
        <span class="Attributes">Time Signature</span>, and
        <span class="Attributes">Valence</span>.</p>

      <p>While most of these attributes measure a specific characteristic of music, a couple of them do overlap. For instance,
        <span class="Attributes">Mode</span> and <span class="Attributes">Key</span> both measure types of key signatures.
        <span class="Attributes">Key</span> is more specific whereas <span class="Attributes">Mode</span> is either major or minor.
        Since it has been proven that people generally like songs in major keys rather than minor keys, I decided to only analyze
        <span class="Attributes">Mode</span>. Another example is <span class="Attributes">Tempo</span> and
        <span class="Attributes">Time Signature</span>. <span class="Attributes">Time Signature</span> specifies the number of
        beats in a measure, but <span class="Attributes">Tempo</span> specifies how fast those beats are played. As a result,
        I decided to only analyze <span class="Attributes">Tempo</span>. I also decided to not look into <span class="Attributes">
        Liveness</span> since this attribute evaluates the presence of an audience in a track. I personally did not want to look
        into this and also because all of my tracks have been produced or re-produced in a studio with no audience. Lastly, the
        final attribute I decided to not include in this project is <span class="Attributes">Loudness</span>. The reason being is
        because as a violinist, I was taught that loudness does not impact whether or not music is good; the quality of music is
        dependent on other variables, which are better demonstrated by the other attributes. The remaining 10 attributes are defined
        in my findings.</p>

      <p>Next, I wrote some Python code that gathered all of these songs, their respective track
        attributes, and printed them in the console for me to transfer to CSV files for each generation. Of course, before
        proceeding to the analysis part of this project, I spell-checked the output and removed any commas. These CSV files,
        as well as the Python code for sifting through the API's output, can all be found on my GitHub repository which is linked
        at the top of the page.</p>

      <p>The analysis portion of this project took place in R. I learned about R in my MATH 352 Statistical Data Analysis course.
        I used the CSV files and imported them into the R workspace to run One Sample t-tests to find 95% confidence intervals,
        Welch Two Sample t-tests in which the variances are not equal, and Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation tests with a variety
        of alternative hypotheses (greater, less, and equal to 0). I also did some linear regression and Nested F Tests in R.
        All of my tests were performed with <span id="alpha">&alpha;</span> = 0.05 and can be found on my GitHub repository. Lastly,
        while I do point out specific minimums, maximums, etc. in my findings, I am not going to list all of the songs with those scores
        since many songs have the same or similar ratings.</p>

    <div class="Comment">
      <p>As demonstrated by the graph, Baby Boomer music has significantly higher Acousticness (or the least amount of electric
        amplification) than any other generation. Generation Z music had the second-highest score for Acousticness. However, the
        Acousticness score for Generation Z is not statistically greater than Millennials or Generation X. In other words, music
        enjoyed by Generation Z, Millennials, and Generation X generally have a similar level of Acousticness. This conclusion
        is supported by the 95% confidence intervals, as these intervals for Generation Z, Millennials, and Generation X
        overlap.</p>

      <p>Looking at the graph and confidence intervals, I am not surprised by the Baby Boomer music's Acousticness scores.
        However, I am surprised by Generation Z. Considering how more and more technology has been integrated into music
        production, I was anticipating Generation Z to have one of the lower Acousticness averages, along with Millennials.
        On the other hand, since Generation X had drastically lower Acousticness than the Baby Boomers, then perhaps
        popular Millennial and Generation Z music artists wanted to decrease the amount of electric amplification to pay homage to
        some of the musicians they looked up to.</p>

      <p>As for Generation X, I am also a bit surprised at how low the Acousticness average is. The musicians popularized by
        Baby Boomers and Gen Xers both include a fair amount of bands (in particular, rock bands). Perhaps this stark
        difference is due to when commercial guitar amps were invented, which was in 1947.

      <p>All four generations appear to have relatively similar Danceability scores, but Millennial music has the greatest on
        average. Next, Generation X and Z both have comparable Danceability and do not differ significantly from each other
        since their confidence intervals have some overlap. However, Baby Boomer music has a statistically lower Danceability
        rating than all of the other generations. The Baby Boomer confidence interval for Danceability does not even
        coincide with Generation Z's, which has the second lowest Danceability average.</p>

      <p>I was surprised by the results for this track attribute. Having heard some of my parents' favorite music, I was under
        the impression that Baby Boomer music was the most "danceable." However, it ranked very low compared to all of the other
        generations. On the other hand, Millennials had the highest ranked Danceability, with Generation X and Z falling in
        between.</p>

      <p>As for further exploration, I ran a correlation test between each generation's Danceability and Tempo track
        attributes (since Spotify claims tempo affects Danceability). Across all 4 generations, Danceability and Tempo are
        inversely related. For Baby Boomers, the correlation coefficient r = -0.2303871 and the p-value = 0.00581; for
        Generation X, r = -0.3595551 and p-value = 1.705e-07; for Millennials, r = -0.6470702 and p-value = 2.216e-14. As for
        Generation Z, r = -0.03936581 and p-value = 0.6336, which strangely, suggests there is no relationship between
        Danceability and Tempo.</p>

      <p>This relationship is weak for Baby Boomers, but moderate to strong for all other generations. Tempo will be explained
        later on in this article, but the average tempo for all generations is around 118 BPM. I speculate a song's Danceability
        decreases when the tempo is too slow and too fast, with the "sweet spot" being centered around Millennial's confidence
        interval for tempo, 107 to 114 BPM. This particular question will be further explored in the Tempo section.</p>

      <p>As depicted in the graph, there appears to be 2 generations with lengthier music and 2 generations with shorter
        music. On average, Generation Z tends to have longer songs than all the other generations, with an average of 5.1
        minutes. Baby Boomers have songs with an average of 4.6 minutes, but this is statistically lower than Generation Z's
        music, as the overlap between these two generations is minimal. Millennials and Generation X both have similar length
        songs with average durations of 3.7 minutes and 3.6 minutes respectively.</p>

      <p>The length of a song has many different factors, but I think it's unlikely that musicians have a target song duration
        in mind when songwriting. Therefore, in addition to not having any other data, I did not feel the need to further
        analyze or speculate why the average durations of these generations' songs differ.</p>

      <p>Similar to the Danceability averages graph, the generations tend to be grouped. As for Energy, Millennials and Generation
        X have similar ratings on average. Generation Z and Baby Boomers both tend to be lower than these two generations, but are
        both similar to each other. Again, the differences in these two groups are statistically significant. The confidence
        intervals further corroborate this.</p>

      <p>Immediately upon analyzing this result, I began to wonder about the connection between Acousticness and Energy. In the
        description that Spotify provides, death metal is compared to the classical music composer Bach. It seemed that Spotify is
        implying acousticness and energy are inversely related. Thus, I began to run another correlation test between these two
        track attributes.</p>

      <p>Starting with the Baby Boomer generation, I was surprised to discover that there is not really any relationship between
        acousticness and energy. The correlation coefficient is 0.04264312 and the p-value is 0.6143.</p>

      <p>However, from Generation X forward, the trend reverses. The correlation coefficient between Acousticness and Energy for
        Generation X music is -0.7923147 and the p-value is < 2.2e-16. As I suspected, there is a high negative correlation between these
        two attributes. Furthermore, music popularized by Millennials also follows this trend, with r = -0.7402408 and the p-value also
        being < 2.2e-16. Popular Generation Z music displays the strongest inverse relationship between Acousticness and Energy, with
        r = -0.8902323 and again, the p-value being < 2.2e-16</p>

      <p>Despite the stark contrasts between each of the four generations' averages for Instrumentalness, Generation X and Z
        are not statistically distinct from one another. They both have relatively similar Instrumentalness ratings on average and
        the confidence intervals overlap greatly. However, Baby Boomers have a significantly lower Instrumentalness score and
        Millennial music even more so. In short, Generation X and Z are similar in terms of Instrumentalness, Baby Boomers come in
        third, and Millennials in fourth.</p>

      <p>Again, the Spotify description (specifically the "ooh" and "aah" section) for this attribute made me wonder if there was
        any relationship between Instrumentalness and Speechiness. Preferably, there should be no relationship between these
        attributes because then, I would think either one or both would be innaccurate.</p>

      <p>After doing some correlation tests, it is clear that for most of the generations, there is essentially no relationship
        between these variables. Many of the p-values were above 0.1, clearly indicating no statistically significant relationship.
        However, for Generation Z, the p-value = 0.0006935 and r = -0.2748376. Although this suggests a small relationship, it
        makes me wonder if popular Generation Z music has a lot more filler sounds, like "ooh" and "aah." As of right now, I do
        not have the data to look into this further.</p>

      <p>The averages represented in this graph indicate the proportion of songs written in a major key. That being said, it
        is evident that there each generation is in its own distinct group as far as mode goes. Baby Boomers have the highest
        proportion of songs written in a major key; far more than the other three generations. Millennials come in with the
        second-highest, Generation X with the third-highest, and Generation Z with the fourth-highest.</p>

      <p>Similar to Duration, there was not anything else that I wanted to look into as far as mode goes. However, I do think
        it is important to mention that the overall trend seems to be that the number of popular songs written in major key
        has generally decreased throughout the years. This may be caused by musicans writing songs more about serious or emotional
        topics. However, I think there were many musicians from every generations that discussed these kinds of topics in their
        songs; for example, The Beatles, Nirvana, Eminem, and Billie Eilish.</p>

      <p>Although not as clear as in the Mode averages graph, the 4 generations each have distinct Speechiness averages.
        The confidence intervals corroborate this as there is little to no overlap in each of the four generations.
        Additionally, as expected, the averages and most of the values are below 0.33, which Spotify suggests is mainly
        music. Generation Z has the largest Speechiness average, followed by Generation X, Millennials, and last but not
        least, Baby Boomers.</p>

      <p>Speechiness was an attribute that interested me from the beginning of this project. After gathering the 10 albums
        from each generation, I noticed that the number of rappers included in the final list increased throughout each
        generation. That being said, I expected Speechiness to steadily increase throughout the 4 generations. However, this
        was generally not the case. Looking further into the data, I realized that the musicians with the highest Speechiness
        rating of 0.438 belong to Smashing Pumpkins and R.E.M., both of whom are not self-proclaimed hip-hop artists.
        Despite this, for the most part, rappers such as Dr. Dre, Eminem, Kanye West, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar do have
        higher-than-average Speechiness scores.</p>

      <p>Average Speechiness Scores:<br>
        X: Smashing Pumpkins – 0.119134<br>
        X: R.E.M. – 0.1099533<br>
        X: Dr. Dre – 0.09469444<br>
        M: Eminem – 0.04617<br>
        Z: Drake – 0.137716<br>
        Z: Kanye West – 0.1312615<br>
        Z: Kendrick Lamar – 0.1474</p>

      <p>With the exception of Eminem, the rappers all had average Speechiness scores well above average.</p>

      <p>As for the fluctuating trend seen in the graph, I looked at each artist's average Speechiness score. Baby Boomers
        typically had scores around 0.03 to 0.04. Generation X had scores often centered around 0.08 with several artists
        having averages around 0.1. Millennials had scores consistently averaging around 0.04. Lastly, Generation Z's artists
        all had Speechiness scores of at least 0.1.</p>

      <p>Overall, these results simply represent the presence of spoken words in a track. However, what truly matters is not
        quantity, but quality.</p>

      <p>Again, this may not be clear from the chart, but the 4 generations can be split into 3 distinct groups based on Tempo.
        Generation X clearly has faster songs on average and its confidence interval is much higher than all the other generations.
        Generation Z has the second fastest songs on average, but its confidence interval overlaps with Millennials. Although
        their intervals overlap, Generation Z music tends to have faster tempo than Baby Boomers on average. However, there is no
        statistically significant distnction between the tempo of Millennial and Baby Boomer music.</p>

      <p>As stated previously, I will test my hypothesis of Tempo having a parabolic shape when used to predict Danceability. To recap,
        for Baby Boomers, this relationship is not very strong to begin with, as its r = -0.2303871 and p-value = 0.00581. Generation
        X displays a stronger relationship between these attributes with its r = -0.3595551 and p-value = 1.705e-07. Millennial
        music has an even greater relationship with a correlation coefficient of -0.6470702 and p-value of 2.216e-14. However,
        Generation Z music breaks the trend and its data suggests that there is no significant relationship between these two attributes.
        Its correlation coefficient is only -0.03936581 and its p-value, 0.6336, is fairly large.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the strength of this relationship, all of these generations display an inverse relationship between Tempo and
        Danceability. Therefore, I am predicting the linear model to be a negative parabola.</p>

      <p>Starting with popular Baby Boomer music, I created the model <span class = "Function">Danceability ~ Tempo</span>. That is,
        <span class = "Function">Danceability = Tempo * a + c</span> where <span class = "Function">a</span> and
        <span class = "Function">c</span> are both unknown constants. R printed the summary of this linear model. This linear model
        has a p-value of 0.00581 and an F-statistic of 7.847 on 1 and 140 degrees of freedom. Clearly, this linear model is useful for
        using Tempo to predict Danceability. The mathematical equation for this model is
        <span class = "Function">Danceability = -0.0008506 * Tempo + 0.5574036</span>. Next, I created the quadratic model,
        <span class = "Function">Danceability ~ I(Tempo)^2 * a + c</span>. R stated that this quadratic model has a
        p-value of 2.745e-11 and an F-statistic of 29.12 on 2 and 139 degrees of freedom. This quadratic model is also useful for
        using Tempo to predict Danceability. The mathematical equation for this model is
        <span class = "Function">Danceability = -0.0000438 * Tempo<sup>2</sup> + 0.0098582 * Tempo - 0.0535306</span>.
        Next, I decided to compare these two models using <span class = "Function">anova</span>
        or R's version of a Nested F Test. The results of this test included a p-value of 1.592e-10, indicating that the quadratic
        model's quadratic term is statistically significant and therefore, the complete model should be used over the reduced.
        Finally, after confirming that the quadratic model is better to use, the estimate R gives for the quadratic term is indeed
        negative, albeit small. In summary, this suggests that there is a "peak" tempo for Baby Boomer music that maximizes
        Danceability and that tempo is 113 BPM for an estimated max Danceability score of 0.501.</p>

      <p>I repeated this process with the rest of the generations:</p>

      <p>Generation X:<br>
        Linear Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -0.0027340 * Tempo + 0.8945102</span><br>
        This model is useful with a p-value = 1.705e-07 and F-statistic of 29.4 on 1 and 198 degrees of freedom.<br>
        Quadratic Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -1.246e-05 * Tempo<sup>2</sup> + 5.844e-04 * Tempo + 0.6819</span><br>
        This model is also useful with a p-value = 9.238e-07 and F-statistic of 14.92 on 2 and 197 degrees of freedom.<br>
        The Nested F Test suggests that the linear model is better at using Tempo to predict Danceability, as the p-value = 0.4723.
        Therefore, there does not appear to be any realistic peak tempo that maximizes Danceability.</p>

      <p>Millennials:<br>
        Linear Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -0.003916 * Tempo + 1.151977</span><br>
        This model is useful with a p-value = 2.216e-14 and F-statistic of 77.79 on 1 and 108 degrees of freedom.<br>
        Quadratic Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -3.909e-05 * Tempo<sup>2</sup> + 5.606e-03 * Tempo + 0.5918</span><br>
        This model is also useful with a p-value = 1.456e-14 and F-statistic of 43.55 on 2 and 107 degrees of freedom.<br>
        The Nested F Test suggests that the quadratic model is better at using Tempo to predict Danceability, as the p-value = 0.01747.
        Therefore, there is a suggested peak tempo that maximizes Danceability for Millennial music and that is 71.7 BPM for an estimated
        max Danceability score of 0.793.</p>

      <p>Generation Z:<br>
        Linear Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -0.0001552 * Tempo + 0.5315042</span><br>
        Surprisingly, this model is not useful since its p-value = 0.6336 and F-statistic = 0.2282 on 1 and 147 degrees of freedom.<br>
        Quadratic Model: <span class = "Function">Danceability = -5.935e-05 * Tempo<sup>2</sup> + 0.01456 * Tempo - 0.3166</span><br>
        This model, however, is also useful with a p-value = 6.445e-07 and F-statistic of 15.74 on 2 and 146 degrees of freedom.<br>
        The Nested F Test suggests that the quadratic model is better at using Tempo to predict Danceability, as the p-value = 1.101e-07.
        Therefore, there is a suggested peak tempo that maximizes Danceability for Generation Z music and that is 123 BPM for an estimated
        max Danceability score of 0.576.</p>

      <p>As seen in previous graphs, the generations tend to be grouped with 2 generations having higher Valence scores and the
        other 2 with lower Valence scores. Millennials have the highest Valence scores on average, followed by Baby Boomers.
        However, since the Valence confidence interval for Millennials has no overlap with the Baby Boomers, Millennials have
        statistically higher Valence on average. After Baby Boomers, Generation X and Z have the two lowest Valence averages.
        Their confidence intervals have major overlap and they are both much less than the Baby Boomer's interval, suggesting
        significantly lower Valence scores on average.</p>

      <p>Another relationship I wanted to explore was between Tempo and Valence. I think happier sounding songs tend to have
        faster tempos. Since Spotify has a track attribute called "valence" that is supposed to measure the "positiveness" of
        a track, I though this would be an appropriate measure to use in relation to tempo to test this theory.</p>

      <p>As it turns out, for the Baby Boomer music, this hypotheses generally holds true; upbeat songs are generally more positive
        than slower songs. The p-value is only 0.0004119 which is much smaller than <span id="alpha">&alpha;</span> = 0.05.
        However, despite this, the correlation coefficient is only 0.2775954, which only suggests low correlation.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Generation X music is the complete opposite and data suggests that slower songs are more positive than fast
        songs. The p-value is 6.603e-07 which is significantly smaller than <span id="alpha">&alpha;</span> = 0.05. However, again, the
        correlation coefficient is -0.3342114 and only infers low correlation.</p>

      <p>Millennial music has a similar outcome as Generation X music. The p-value is 3.623e-05 which is also much smaller than
        <span id="alpha">&alpha;</span> = 0.05 and the correlation coefficient is -0.3691063, suggesting low correlation. All in all,
        more positive-sounding Millennial music tends to be slower.</p>

      <p>As for Generation Z, there appears to be very little correlation between valence and tempo. The p-value is 0.3367 which is
        not smaller than <span id="alpha">&alpha;</span> = 0.05, so I cannot conclude that valence and tempo are positively related.
        Additionally, the correlation coefficient is 0.03481944 which again, implies that there is close to no relationship between
        those two track attributes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Questions">
      <p><b>Overarching Themes</b> <br>
        Lastly, I tried to look for patterns and relationships among track attributes for the entire set of 601 songs. In order to
        answer this, I reviewed each generation's correlation matrix and the correlation matrix of all the data combined.
        While there were many relationships between attributes within each generation, there were two pairs of track attributes
        that I discovered in the combined correlation matrix: (1) Valence and Danceability and (2) Acousticness and Energy.</p>

      <p>The Valence and Danceability pairing had a correlation coefficient of 0.426540564, suggesting moderate correlation, with a
        p-value less than 2.2e-16. This particular relationship suggests that across these 4 generations, popular music with higher Valence
        have higher Danceability and vice versa. This trend also appears within each generation, although to varying extents. Baby
        Boomers displayed a low correlation between these two track attributes with r = 0.3772867 and p-value = 3.685e-06. Generation
        X showed at moderate correlation with r = 0.4156355 and p-value = 9.341e-10. Millennials should the strongest relationship
        overall with r = 0.6266014 and p-value = 2.442e-13. On the other hand, Generation Z music had the lowest relationship with
        r = 0.1931371 and p-value = 0.01828.</p>

      <p>The Acousticness and Energy pairing had a correlation coefficient of -0.661279313,
        suggesting high correlation, with a p-value also less than 2.2e-16. This relationship suggests that across these 4 generations,
        popular music with higher Acousticness has lower Energy and vice versa. Despite my findings indicating that the Baby Boomer
        generation displays no relationship between these two attributes, they appear to have a generally strong relationship over time.</p>

    <div class="Conclusion">
      <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
        Overall, this data analysis project was both fun and challenging. I really enjoyed learning about each of the four generation's
        music preferences and explore Spotify's database. In summary, I found Baby Boomer music to be characterized by easy-going tunes with
        high levels of acousticness and positiveness. Generation X music has a lot of rock elements such as high levels of instrumentalness,
        faster tempo, and lower levels of Valence. Millennial music tends to be extremely energetic and in turn, very "danceable" and
        happy-sounding — exuding the birth of true pop music. Last, but not least, Generation Z music was in a league of its own as it
        oftentimes didn't share the same trends as the other 3 generations. However, I would describe my generation's music to be heavily
        influenced by rap where speech and the music/beat balance each other out and overall, tends to be more brooding (for a lack of a
        better term).</p>

      <p>However, despite the results, I would like to gain some more clarity on how Spotify rates and describes each attribute. Although
        looking through all of the data they have created and gathered was interesting, I disagreed with some of my results and found the
        descriptions for some of the attributes to be vague. For instance, I thought Instrumentalness would be significantly higher for
        Baby Boomers and lower for Generation Z. Moreover, the description for this attribute includes "ooh" and "aah" sounds as instruments.
        I disagree with that portion of the description since many pop songs use "ooh" and "aah" as repetitive sounds to fill the gaps in
        lyrics. Additionally, while Speechiness is divided into different sections (for example: music, "spoken" music, and podcasts), I
        think it makes this attribute more confusing and possibly harder to gauge. On a different note, I think many of the attributes
        overlap. For instance, Energy implicitly states in its description that lower Acousticness equates to higher Energy. Again, I think
        this "codependency" may make it harder to analyze music using Spotify's database. I assume that Spotify has a program that "listens" to
        every track that is uploaded to their platform and due to these vague descriptions, so I think there is more error in this database
        than one might expect.</p>

      <p>Analyzing music is a tricky task and of course, could upset many music lovers. Again, music is subjective; numbers cannot justify or
        quantify music. However, despite these flaws in Spotify's database it was truly an enjoyable experience and the results that I have
        found are purely to fuel my intellectual curiousity.</p>
