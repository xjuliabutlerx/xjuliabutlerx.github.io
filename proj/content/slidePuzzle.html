    <div class="Project_Description">
      <p>This is a game that I made for my final project in my first Computer Science class, CSCI 141 - Computational Problem Solving.
        Everyone in the class was required to make a 15-cell sliding puzzle with a leaderboard that was stored in a plain text file.
        However, we were encouraged to "customize" the game to our liking for bonus points. I describe the game's algorithm in a PDF on my
        GitHub repository, so I will briefly discuss the details I added.</p>

      <p>The color scheme of my game is the same as the official school colors for William & Mary (green and gold). I wanted to show some
        school spirit and found this to be a great palette for the game. Additionally, I added in some sound effects and background
        music. The sound effects include block noises when the player is shifting blocks and a "level up sound" when the player solves
        the puzzle. As for the background music, I also wanted to show off my personality, so I picked Mii background music and the
        instrumental verison of a BTS song. I also added in an option for no background music for people who don't like those kinds of
        music or are easily distracted.</p>

      <p>In addition to these features, another detail that I worked the most on is a pop-up window at the end of the game to ask
        if the player would like to play again or quit. I had to look up how to do this in the documentation, but it ended up working
        pretty well.</p>

      <p>Feel free to watch this video of my game in action!</p>
