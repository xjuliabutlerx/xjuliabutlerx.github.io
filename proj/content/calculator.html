      <p><b>Introduction</b> <br>

      Over my winter break, I purchased <em>The Most Complete Starter Kit for Mega 2560</em> from Amazon. This is an Arduino
      kit made by the company Elegoo. The kit comes with a variety of resistors, bread boards, accessories (such as LEDs, ultrasonic
      sensors, etc.), and the Elegoo microcontroller board Mega 2560 Rev3 (comparable to Arduino's board). After going through all the
      modules in the starter kit, I decided to embark on my own project with the hardware: a calculator.</p>

      <p>I thought this would be a good starter project since many computer science students create calculator apps. In this project,
      I would not only extend my programming skills with the
      <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a>, but also learn more about wiring Arduino/Elegoo
      hardware. A picture of the finished project is below. In the following article, I will explain how I wired the calculator, made
      the algorithm, the roadblocks I faced, and summarize my calculator's abilities and constraints. The code for my calculator can be
      found in my GitHub repository, linked above.</p>

      <p class="Note">Note: Since the LCD module (blue screen) is hard to capture on my phone's camera, I am providing what is printed
      on the screen below each picture.</p>

      <p><b>Process</b> <br>

      After sifting through the accessories that came with the Starter Kit, I realized that the membrane switch module and LCD 1602 module
      would be ideal for the calculator's keypad and display. In order to use both of these modules, I also had to use the breadboard,
      multiple jumper wires, and the potentiometer module (to adjust the contrast of the LCD). The source of power for the calculator is
      my computer.</p>

      <p>I followed the instructions from the
        <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1oC-c3G5TS.pdf" target="_blank">Starter Kit</a>
      for both the membrane switch and LCD 1602 modules. I had just enough Digital PWM I/O pins to support both of these accessories. I
      took an iterative approach with wiring my calculator. I started with the LCD module and made sure this was working before anything
      else.</p>

      <p>Hello, World!<br>This is Julia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Project_Body">
      <p>Next, I set up the membrane switch module. There are 16 buttons on this keypad. I let the numbers represent the numbers, but I made
      the letters (A, B, C, and D) represent four different mathematical operations. A is for addition, B is for subtraction, C is for
      multiplication, and D is for division. As for the star (*) and pound (#) buttons, I made those the clear and equal buttons respectively.
      Before moving onto programming the calculator, I tested the input from the membrane switch module and the output on the LCD display.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Project_Body">
      <p><b>Algorithm</b> <br>
      After wiring the calculator, I had to design the calculator program. I broke up this part of the project into two parts: parsing the
      input and calculating. Before going on to the specifics of the algorithm, a goal I established for myself is for my calculator to
      be able to evaluate long expressions and follow PEMDAS (order of operations).</p>

      <p><em>Parsing Input</em> <br>
      For starters, I limited the length of the input to 16 characters (operands and operators). Any longer expression would be
      truncated. Arduino programs have a built in loop function that will run continuously. I used this loop to keep the keypad ready
      to accept input at any given time. As the user inputs numbers and arithmetic operators, the program adds those tokens into either
      an expression array or an operations array and builds a string with the full expression. These three objects will be used while
      calculating the answer.</p>

      <p>The next step while parsing input is making sure that the input is a valid, infix mathematical expression. I came up with
      5 cases in which the given expression could be invalid. First, the expression can't be blank. Next, the first and last
      characters/tokens should not be arithmetic operators. (As a result, another constraint on the input is that the user cannot give
      an expression with negative numbers. However, this could be easily bypassed if they exchange the negative number with some
      kind of subtraction expression). Fourth, the expression cannot have two arithmetic operators next to each other
      (ex. <span class="Code">//</span> or <span class="Code">--</span>). Lastly, the number of arithmetic operators in an expression
      cannot be equal to or greater than the number of operands. In order to validate expressions, I have all of this logic in its own
      <span class="Code">isValid()</span> function. If the expression is invalid, then it will print
      <span class="Code">Syntax Error</span> on the screen. Examples of all of these cases are below.</p>

      <p><em>Calculating</em> <br>
      While taking input, the calculator puts all the operands into an expression array and all the operators into an operators
      array. Both of these arrays can hold up to 16 operands or operators. There is a counter variable that keeps track of the next
      available cell for both arrays. As input is received, the counter increments and separates the operators and operands into
      their respective arrays. However, if I was to merge these two arrays, no data would be lost or overwritten. In the example
      below, the expression array is the first row and the operators array is the second row. (The underscores represent an
      empty cell).</p>

      <p class="Note">Note: the word <span class="Code">empty</span> in the following table denotes a variable which I have assigned
      to be <span class"Code">-9999</span> and represent an "empty" cell in the expression table. The number <span class="Code">0</span>
      is used to represent an empty cell in the operators array.</p>

      <p>Before starting any calculation, the algorithm will check if the operations array is blank. If there are no operators in this
      array and the input is still valid, then the user gave a single number. In this case, the calculator will just print that given
      operand. This can be seen in the following example.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Single_Image">
      <img src="../../img/calculator_project/Single_Operand.jpg" width="500" height ="650">

    <div class="Project_Body">
      <p>However, that is not likely to happen. In most cases, there is at least one operator. The calculation algorithm will go
      through all of the current operators in the operators array from left to right. The mathematical operations were assigned negative
      numbers to identify which operation should be done. (Addition is -1, subtraction is -2, multiplication is -3, and division is -4).
      As a result, the algorithm will find the mathematical operation with the lowest number and then go from there. However, since
      PEMDAS must be used for infix expressions, I added in some logic so that subtraction isn't prioritized over addition and
      division isn't prioritized over multiplication. Namely, if the current lowest number is -1 and the only other cell in the array
      is -2 (denoting subtraction), the algorithm will not do the subtraction first. The same goes for multiplication and division.
      Of course, if the operation is multiplication or division, these operations will always be prioritized over addition and
      subtraction.</p>

      <p>After the algorithm determines which operation in the expression to do first, then it will find the indicies of the cells of
      the operands to operate on. It will take the index of the operator, go to the expression array, and find the nearest operand
      to its left and right. Then, it will do the operation and place the result in the index of the operator in the expression array.</p>

      <p>Looking at the same example as before, the first operator that would be evaluated in the expression would be the multiplication
      operator in the 4th cell (index 3). The algorithm would find that the closest operand to the 4th cell of the expression array is
      78. To its right, the closest operand would be 2.</p>

      <p>Next, the algorithm completes these instructions. The next part of the expression that it would evaluate is 150/5, which
      has a similar structure to the multiplication operation. After that, the algorithm would evaluate 878-156 and so on. Overall,
      the operations array is reduced to all 0's and the expression array will only have 1 value left that is not
      <span class="Code">empty</span>, which is the answer. Once the algorithm verifies this, then it will return the value
      remaining in the expression array.</p>

      <p>Last but not least, there are a couple notes about my calculator's division. First, since my program uses integer arrays
      for both the operands and operators, it can only do integer division. In other words, any quotients with decimal points will
      be rounded down. Specifically, 5/20 (0.25) and 99/100 (0.99) both evaluate to 0 on my calculator even though the latter
      expression is much closer to 1 than the former. Second, I also added in some logic to handle cases in which the user
      might try to divide by zero. The right operand (denominator) is checked before the operation is executed.</p>

      Since this is a calculator, I wanted to ensure its functionality was reliable so I tested a variety of outputs from simple to

      <p>Although not pictured, I also tested expressions that exceeded 16 characters to ensure that my program truncated the
      extra operators or operands.</p>

      <p><b>Roadblocks</b><br>
      While working on this project, I came across several problems. The first two involve issues with wiring. First, I had
      some trouble setting up my LCD module. I had to look at a
      <a href="https://youtu.be/dpoBwmuE2QE" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> for extra guidance. I soon realized that
      my potentiometer was too close to the LCD module on the bread board, so I moved it to the far left.</p>

      <p>Second, I had just enough digital PWM pins to support both a keyboard and LCD display. This was great, however, on
      the Mega 2560, digital pins 0 and 1 are reserved for Serial (the console). If I was going to use the keyboard and display
      together, then I was going to have to test all of my output on the display because the Serial wouldn't work. This was
      especially tricky because the display had a limited amount of characters it could print and I did not want the display to
      autoscroll from left to right. There wasn't any real solution for this problem, but I made it work with just the LCD.
      Additionally, I had to modify the Starter Kit instructions since they typically used the middle 5-12 digital pins in their
      tutorials, but this wasn't a major setback.</p>

      <p>Next, I had some programming roadblocks. The Arduino programming language is most similar to C++. However, it lacks
      some useful features such as a lists library (dynamic arrays) and macros, such as null (to test if a cell was empty).
      I think my program/algorithm would have been more efficient and simple if I had access to these kinds of C++ features.
      However, I developed my own workarounds. (Again, there weren't any specific solutions to these problems). For dynamic
      arrays, I simply added the constraint that the expression had to be 16 characters or less. For the lack of macros, I
      defined my own at the top of the program, namely <span class="Code">empty</span>. This particular macro was only used
      for the expression array since although computing negative numbers are possible, it's extremely unlikely for them to equal
      -9999 and given operands must be positive.</p>

      <p>Lastly, I was able to implement logic to handle dividing by 0, but the output is still not ideal. In one of the pictures
      above, you can see <span class="Code">Division Error-9</span> printed on the screen. The -9 is part of -9999, the value of
      the <span class="Code">empty</span> macro. This is because, if the expression is valid, the algorithm will print a cell
      from the expression array regardless, which usually ends up being <span class="Code">empty</span>. Since the expression
      might not have 0 as a given operand or might evaluate a part of the expression to 0 at a later stage, it is not possible
      to stop the program in the middle of the calculation algorithm (since the calculation function is called by a different
      function that has a <span class="Code">while</span> loop).</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
      In summary, my calculator can accept mathematical infix expressions and evaluate them using PEMDAS. There are 3 constraints
      in regards to input on my calculator: 1) expressions must be 16 characters or less, 2) the user cannot evaluate an
      expression with a negative number (although there is a workaround for this), and 3) operands cannot be numbers with decimals.
      The only constraint in regards to output on my calculator is that any quotients with decimal points will be rounded down.
      One final constraint that I did not have control over was the range of <span class="Code">int</span> in the Arduino IDE, which
      ranges from -32,768 to 32,767 <sup><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Int" target="_blank">[source]</a></sup>. Any
      result or subresult with a number outside this range will cause integer overflow and therefore, an inaccurate solution.</p>

      <p>Since I had plans to get my feet wet with electrical engineering, this was a fun, rewarding, and challenging project for
      me to work on over my spring break. In the future, I hope to revisit this project and improve the algorithm to account for
      floating point results and other roadblocks. I also plan to continue building more robots/machines using Elegoo/Arduino
      hardware and learning more about the Arduino IDE.</p>
