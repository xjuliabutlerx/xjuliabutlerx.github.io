        During my first term on the William & Mary Undergraduate Honor Council, I noticed an issue the executive board
        was having and took initiative by developing a Python application that helps delegate casework more evenly and tracks
        participation statistics. This program works with Google Drive to track participation statistics for the Honor Council. Some of
        the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include PyQt5, Python's Google Drive API, and information on Majors & Minors
        from William & Mary's website.</p>
