      <p><a href="proj/content/spotifyProject.html" target="_self">Spotify Generational Music Trends</a> | <em>Summer 2021</em> <br>
        As a typical Gen Zer, I tune into Spotify to listen to music. This summer, after researching Spotify's API and music database,
        I decided to start my first statistics/data analysis project and explore generational music trends. Some of the tools/libraries
        I used to complete this project include the Spotify Python API Spotipy, Python, R, and Tableau Public.</p>

      <p><a href="proj/content/website.html" target="_self">GitHub Pages Personal Website</a> | <em>Summer 2021</em> <br>
        Another aspect of computer science that fascinates me is web development. This summer, I decided to challenge myself to learn some
        of the basics in order to build a personal website that displays my projects, academic endeavors, and interests. Some of the
        tools/libraries I used to complete this project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub Pages, and Google Fonts.</p>

      <p><a href="proj/content/HonorCouncilApp.html" target="_self">Honor Council Participation App</a> | <em>Summer 2020</em> <br>
        During my first term on the William & Mary Undergraduate Honor Council, I noticed an issue the executive board
        was having and took initiative by developing a Python application that helps delegate casework more evenly and tracks
        participation statistics. This program works with Google Drive to track participation statistics for the Honor Council. Some of
        the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include Python, PyQt5, and a Google Drive API.</p>

      <p><a href="proj/content/slidePuzzle.html" target="_self">15-Cell Slide Puzzle</a> | <em>Spring 2020</em> <br>
        In my first college Computer Science course, I made this 15-cell slide puzzle and customized it with some colors and sound
        effects. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include Python and PyQt5.</p>

      <p><a href="proj/content/gradeTracker.html" target="_self">Universal Grade Tracker</a> | <em>Academic Year 2018-19</em> <br>
        In my senior year of high school, I took the CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science Principles course and produced this Universal
        Grade Tracker, which helped me earn a 5/5 on the AP exam. This app was made with the Code.org platform and JavaScript.</p>
