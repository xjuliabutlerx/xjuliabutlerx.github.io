            <p>I have always wanted to learn more about machine learning and machine intelligence, so I found a brief introductory project to familiarize myself with the discipline over the summer. I followed project instructions from <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Mastery</a> and completed the project on a weekend when I had some downtime from my internship.</p>

            <a href="proj/content/calculator.html" target="_self"><strong>Calculator</strong></a> <span>| <em>Spring 2022</em></span>
            <p>A common project that many computer science students have in their project portfolio is a calculator app. The small twist that I have done for my calculator project is that I not only programmed a calculator app, but I have also used materials from the Elegoo Starter Kit to build the calculator itself. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include parts from the Elegoo Starter Kit for Mega 2560 and Arduino IDE (programming language equivalent to a mix of C++, Java, and C#).</p>

            <a href="proj/content/spotifyProject.html" target="_self"><strong>Spotify Generational Music Trends</strong></a> <span>| <em>Summer 2021</em></span>
            <p>As a typical Gen Zer, I tune into Spotify to listen to music. This summer, after researching Spotify's API and music database, I decided to start my first statistics/data analysis project and explore generational music trends. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include the Spotify Python API Spotipy, Python, R, and Tableau Public.</p>

            <p>Another aspect of computer science that fascinates me is web development. This summer, I decided to challenge myself to learn some of the basics in order to build a personal website that displays my projects, academic endeavors, and interests. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub Pages, and Google Fonts.</p>

            <a href="proj/content/honorCouncilApp.html" target="_self"><strong>Honor Council Participation App</strong></a> <span>| <em>Summer 2020</em></span>
            <p>During my first term on the William & Mary Undergraduate Honor Council, I noticed an issue the executive board was having and took initiative by developing a Python application that helps delegate casework more evenly and tracks participation statistics. This program works with Google Drive to track participation statistics for the Honor Council. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include Python, PyQt5, and a Google Drive API.</p>

            <p>In my first college Computer Science course, I made this 15-cell slide puzzle and customized it with some colors and sound effects. Some of the tools/libraries I used to complete this project include Python and PyQt5.</p>

            <a href="proj/content/gradeTracker.html" target="_self"><strong>Universal Grade Tracker</strong></a> <span>| <em>Academic Year 2018-19</em></span>
            <p>In my senior year of high school, I took the CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science Principles course and produced this Universal Grade Tracker, which helped me earn a 5/5 on the AP exam. This app was made with the Code.org platform and JavaScript.</p>
