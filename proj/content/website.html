      <!-- Introduction to Project-->
      <p>After finishing my sophomore year of college, I had a better understanding of software development, data structures,
        and algorithms, which gave me many ideas for personal computer science projects. However, I wanted to have a place where
        I could display my project portfolio. Additionally, I noticed that many of my peers had personal websites to share their
        projects and knowledge with the world.</p>

      <p>That being said, I began to research tools that I could use to build my website. I was somewhat familiar with HTML and have
        made single-page HTML sites for fun and to explore. However, I was not acquainted with CSS, so I took a
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css" target="_blank">Codecademy course</a>
         to learn more about it. After learning these coding languages, I turned my attention to the next task at hand: finding a
        domain.</p>

      <p>Most of the options available for web domains would cost me anywhere from $100-150/year. For a college student, this was
        obviously not ideal. However, I came in luck when I stumbled upon one of my professor's personal websites, which was hosted on
        GitHub Pages. After further research, I discovered that GitHub provided a free domain linked to every GitHub account based on
        username. From that point on, it was a no-brainer. Before delving into the coding, I watched some of GitHub Page's tutorial videos
        and looked at other websites hosted by them for inspiration on layout and formatting.</p>

      <p>In order to maintain creative control over the layout and formatting of my website, I decided to not opt for a CSS Bootstrap.
        Although it meant this aspect of my website would be done completely manually and made more tedious, it has been quite fun.
        I relied heavily on tutorials provided by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to continue filling
        in the gaps of my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Another important aspect of website development that I have learned is connecting multiple coding languages to make a final
        product. While I have made multi-file Python, C++, and Java apps/programs, this has been quite different for me since these
        languages differ from each other so greatly in terms of syntax and purpose. At a later date, I plan on cleaning up my code
        and refactoring to make it easier to maintain.</p>

      <p>As of the summer of 2021, I am still learning how to develop websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I am very proud of
        what this website looks like and plan to continue maintaining it in the future. It has been a very fulfilling project for me.</p>

      <p><br></p>

      <p class="Update">August 31, 2021 Update: I noticed on a Windows computer that my website had Times New Roman font rather than
        Avenir Next. Upon further research, I discovered that only Apple devices come with the Avenir Next font and other devices would
        have to purchase the font. Additionally, I became aware of "web safe fonts," or fonts that generally every computer and web
        browser supports. Due to differences in technology, some people would view my website in a different font. However, a solution
        to this problem was to rely on "fallback fonts," or fonts that computers could rely on if the preferred font is not supported
        or downloaded. While searching for fallback font solutions, I came across Google Fonts which are free to use. I found a font
        called "Nunito" that is a fairly close match to Avenir Next and edited all of the HTML and CSS files for my website. Now, the
        website should look similar across all computers and web browsers.</p>
